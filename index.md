# Katana <small>â€” have your cake and eat it</small>

## What is katana?

**Katana** is a general-purpose programming language currently under development as a research project at the Department of Computing of the [Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais](http://decom.cefetmg.br).

The language goal is to combine JavaScript's semantics with C's performance and predictability. Its no-compromise approach makes it ideal for writing games, web servers, compilers and mobile applications.

Once fully-functional, the Katana compiler will use your existing C compiler as a back-end, so that you can quickly get your code running on just about anything.

## Language Features

- Object Orientation with Prototypal Inheritance
- JS-Like objects & arrays
- JSON for denoting object literals
- First class functions + closures
- Automatic Reference Counting
- Late *this* binding.
- CommonJS-like modules with automatic compilation of dependencies
- Small runtime library
- C-like syntax
- Optional Python-like offside syntax

## What does it look like? 

Katana's syntax makes the language look very similar to other C-like languages. At the same time, it allows for optional indentation-defined blocks, and for the omission of semicolons.
